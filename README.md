# htask

1. Correct all of the deficiencies in index.html

2. "Sectors" selectbox:

    2.1. Add all the entries from the "Sectors" selectbox to database

    2.2. Compose the "Sectors" selectbox using data from database
    
    I switched to using checkboxes, it composed better. Not fully happy with the result but its something. Im bad with css tho so it aint pretty.
 

3. Perform the following activities after the "Save" button has been pressed:

    3.1. Validate all input data (all fields are mandatory)

    3.2. Store all input data to database (Name, Sectors, Agree to terms)

    I added name conflict checking. Not in the task but seemed like something that should be checked against.

    3.3. Refill the form using stored data

    3.4. Allow the user to edit his/her own data during the session

# Things i didnt do:

Tests - there are paths that need some testing.

Proper git history.

Decent CSS.
